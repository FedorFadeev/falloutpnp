Fallout Pen and Paper 2.0 is a Fallout-themed Pen and Paper roleplaying game which was created by Jason Mical, can be found [here](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/falloutpnp/images/4/43/Fallout_pnp_2_0.pdf/revision/latest?cb=20210308185741).

If you ever wanted to play Fallout 1 or 2 in a tabletop setting, this is the system for you. As such, any 'broken' or 'unbalanced' mechanics are translated over, as they are part of the original games.

It features a complete SPECIAL system and has several races of characters including humans, ghouls, super mutants, half mutants, deathclaws, dogs and robots. It contains a large variety of weapons and armor from both the Fallout universe and Fallout predecessor, Wasteland.

This project attempts to simplify character creation and play by auto-calculating a bunch of statistics and providing roll macros, as well as a detailed character sheet.

## Contributing

If you are a developer, pull requests are welcome.

If you are not a developer, you can still help by providing feedback on the system, reporting bugs, or suggesting improvements - just open a github issue in the Issues tab. Or consider [getting into development](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/SD-tutorial)!

## Setup
The only dependency of the project is [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), which is used to simplify styling of the character sheets files. When deciding to make styling changes, you will need to compile the SASS files into CSS files. To do this:

Install dependencies:
1. [git](https://git-scm.com/)
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

Make sure you have a local Foundry VTT tion.

Clone the repo into a local folder in your dev environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FedorFadeev/falloutpnp.git
```

<details>
<summary>Where to clone the folder?</summary>

<br/>

For Windows development, we recommend cloning the repo directly to the Foundry VTT Data folder, which is typically located at `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT\Data\systems\`.

If you're on MacOS, Linux or using WSL2, you can clone the repo to a different location and symlink the system folder to the Foundry VTT Data folder:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/falloutpnp /path/to/foundryvtt/Data/systems/falloutpnp
```
</details>

<br/>

From within the folder, install dependencies with pnpm.

```bash
pnpm i
```

And run automatic compiling of SASS files with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
